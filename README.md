# Intro to Modern JavaScript

## Running Example Code

You need to run a local webserver to be able to lode the CSV file. If you have Python installed, you can run the following in a terminal from the directory where the example files are:

~~~bash
python -m http.server
~~~

The result should look something like:

~~~bash
python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...
~~~

Then you should be able to load [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) or whatever port the output shows.
